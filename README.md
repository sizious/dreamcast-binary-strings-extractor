# Dreamcast Binary Strings Extractor

This tool has been written in order to extract strings for **Katana** (`.BIN`) 
executables, helping you to translate a **Dreamcast** game in your language (you know,
this is "ROM hacking").

This tool is in proof-of-concept state only, it was never released to public.

# Usage
	dcstrex <dc_exec.bin> <output.csv> <addr_base>
	
The output generated will be in `CSV` format (can be opened in any spreadsheet
software).
